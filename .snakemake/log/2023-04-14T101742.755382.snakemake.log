rule all:
    output: output/ultranew.json
    jobid: 5
    reason: Missing output files: output/ultranew.json
    resources: tmpdir=/tmp

[Fri Apr 14 10:17:43 2023]
Error in rule all:
    jobid: 5
    output: output/ultranew.json
    shell:
        bash/jq.sh > output/ultranew.json
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job all since they might be corrupted:
output/ultranew.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
